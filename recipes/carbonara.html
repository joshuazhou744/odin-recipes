    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Carbonara originated in Rome, Italy in the 1940's. 
        It is a pasta dish made with long spaghetti noodles, hard cheese, egg yolk and pork.
        The most important aspect of the dish comes from the cheese.
        Traditionally, Parmigiano Regiano and Pecorino Romano Cheese are used.
        For the meat, a special cured pork called guanciale is used.
        Though modern recipes use bacon as they are essentially the same.
